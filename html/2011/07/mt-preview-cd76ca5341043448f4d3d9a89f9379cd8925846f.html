								<h2>Car Found and a "Normal" Day</h2>
								<p>Well, the best news of all for Doug's birthday today was that our car was not stolen, but merely parked in a different spot from where Bryn thought, in his jet-lagged mind, it was left. We had quite a busy morning leading up to that memory jog though... long phone chats with both our insurance company, Allstate, who were just great!and with the car rental people whom we contacted to get wheels right away. It was while the driver was on his way to get us that Bryn googled up a map of the area where he was last night, and was quite sure he was a block off in his recollections. The friendly driver from Enterprise took us there, and there was the car, just where Bryn was sure it would be. </p>

<p>So, our day went as planned after all. We drove out to the Outer Sunset district so that Mirei could say hello to her former Japanese teacher at "Little Angels". The school was locked up but "Arizmendi", our favourite bakery was open, just two blocks away, so we stopped in for a slice of their delicious pizza sitting outside in the sunshine. It was just a perfect San Francisco day; the weather was not too hot, and not too cool, the streets were busy with families and couples enjoying the neighbourhoods, and we were very relaxed, basking in having our own car under our hands. </p>

<p>Mirei and I loaded her bike into the car, and drove over to a nearby playground for an hour and a bit. It took a few minutes before she was comfortable riding down slopes, but before long she was speeding along, but doing a great job of looking up and keeping her bike to the right. We had time for some climbing and sliding too, before heading home for the evening routine. </p>
